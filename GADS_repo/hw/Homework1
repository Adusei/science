#Homework 1 Due 11/18

For the homework, we want you to predict the presence of heart disease in the patient.

##Questions 
1 - Train your logistic regression model with the training set applying 10-fold cross-validation. 

	(a) Report the average AUC as well as misclassification rate (percent of times you guessed the label wrong).  



2 - Train your model applying 5-fold cross-validation, but this time to select the features. 

	Hint: This construct might help: features.iloc[:,index]

	(a) Report the average AUC. Note that the code is very similar to first question, only this time we select the features, rather than the records. 

	(b) If you want to reduce the number of features, which two features would you remove from the model first (hint: RFECV ). 



The code will be available Monday night. Thanks!
