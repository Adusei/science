What is big data >

1. o(n^2) algorithm feasible?: small data
	-- > all of the possible outcomes... if i can wait around for this its small
	-- > n = number of records in your data set
	-- > n^2 is a quadritic (ex. loop with in a loop)
2. fits on one machine: medium data
3. doesnt fit on one machine: big dat


What is Machine Learning?

	Generalization ant Representation

	Supervised problems: making predictions
	un supervives problems: defining structure

	You must have information about the target variable for supervies
	You know the dependent variables.. if you don't know the

  							continuous               categorical
--------------------------------------------------------
|supervised   |Regression             | classification  |
|unsupervised |Dimension Reduction    | clustering      |
--------------------------------------------------------


Dimension Reduction 
	-> matrix reductions to map high dimensional data into lower dimensional feature space
  -> usually w sparse data sets..

Goal of machine learning Generalization (supervised) and Representation (Unsupervised)

Regression Vs. Classification
	- classification -> trying to bucket a values
	- regression -> trying to predict a value
	- dimension reduction 
		-> continuous and unsupervised 
		-> 

	Feature Space:
		- were does the data live?
		- dbtable with 3 columns has 3 dimensions (this is the feature space)

UNIX HELP
- man
- cntl-l: wipes out screen
- create alias for  ls -alG (ll)
- install tmux (multiple bash screens)
- download wget
