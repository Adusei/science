LINEAR REGRESSION 
 ---------------------
 | y = b + mx + (er) |
 ---------------------

er (error terms) is normally and perfectly distributed


-Logistic Regression
 	- > what type of machine learning problem is this?
 			- generalization of the linear regression model to clasification problems
 	- > predicting some probablity (0,1) for a binary class membership 
 	- > what type of machine learning problem is this?
 	    - Supervised(we know the values of the outputes) and Categorical (trying to decide if this is bucket 1 or 2)
 	    - classificattion! 
 	- > The logistic regresion model is an extension of the linear regression model.. with a few differences
  - >  outcome varaibles 
 				- the key variable in any regression probelm is the conditional mean of the outcome variable y given the value of the covariate x
 					- E(y|x)
 				- logistic function and logit function(log-odds function)
 	- >  error terms
 				- linear regression - error terms are on a gausian distribution
 				- logistic regresion, outcome is zero or 1 (bernoulli distribution)
 						- Distribution followed by a coin toss
  - > generalized linear models: unification of regression techinues
 				- generalize distribtuion of the error term
 				- logit is the canonical link function for bernoulli distribution
  - > interpreting results
  			- linear regresn B represents change in the response variable for unit change in covariate
  			- logistic regression b represents change in Logit Function 
  			- relationship between odds ratio and parameter (B or Slope)
  				 " the odds ration of a binary events..."
