KNN algorithm

TERMS
	- Non Parametric
	- Parametric
	- Non Generalizing
		- > local vs. global hypothesis - logistic regression is a global hypthesis
  - Lazy Learner (Push computational complexity into Test)

What does a logistic regression output?
	- Vector of Parameters.. 

Logistic Regression 
	- fitting a model produces a vector of parameter

Training STep
	- Storing points in memory

Test Set 
	- for ev
	- for every query point in test set find KNN
		- calculate distance between every point in your training set
		- form a prediction (create a local hypothesis)

TEST is very computationally expensive
TRAIN is not computationaly complex (just storing records)


Chosing the value of K
	- Be careful of Ties (use an odd number)

WHat does "nearest Mean"
	- > chose proper metrics
	- > how do u make every problem you have to solve into one i know how to solve

Ways to Embed Features into Metric Space
	- > Taccard Coefficient
	- > Term Frequency
	- > Document Frequency

What do you need to perform a KNN Algorithm
	- > you need a metric


VC Dimmension of 1nn is Infinity
	- > THIs is when the model is infinitly complex

Varonoi Diagram (tesalation)
	- > sample (dots)
	- > nearest neighbor are in the same cell
	- > for a given sample, the nearest sample
	- > euclidean metric vs taxi cab metric


Add as executable
chmod - x (file name)


CONFUSION MATRIX
	- > Iris KNN is 3X3


					TRUE LABELS

PREDICTED

confusion matrix:
[[17  0  0]
 [ 0 17  1]
 [ 0  0 10]] 


PARAMETRIC VS NON PARAMETRIC

Who won the race vs. what was the winning time


Decision Boundries
	- Linear vs. Non Linear


KNN can give you a complex decision boundry, but that leads to a complex model

TODO!
-Pick a time slot to discuss projcet
-Send Denis my HW
-Check out Kaggle Competition
