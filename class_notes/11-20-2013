KNN algorithm

TERMS
	- Non Parametric
	- Parametric
	- Non Generalizing
		- > local vs. global hypothesis - logistic regression is a global hypthesis
  - Lazy Learner (Push computational complexity into Test)

What does a logistic regression output?
	- Vector of Parameters.. 

Logistic Regression 
	- fitting a model produces a vector of parameter

Training STep
	- Storing points in memory

Test Set 
	- for ev
	- for every query point in test set find KNN
		- calculate distance between every point in your training set
		- form a prediction (create a local hypothesis)

TEST is very computationally expensive
TRAIN is not computationaly complex (just storing records)


Chosing the value of K
	- Be careful of Ties (use an odd number)

WHat does "nearest Mean"
	- > chose proper metrics
	- > how do u make every problem you have to solve
