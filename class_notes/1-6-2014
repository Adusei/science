MAP REDUCE
 - A horizontal distributed system also has better fault tolerance than a single machine

Within a cluster there are two ways to process data:

1. move data to code 
	- SETI (search for extra terrestrial intelligence)
2. move code to data
	- Map Reduce
	- "computing nodes are the same as storage nodes"

Divide and Conquer!
	- Split Tasks into Subtasks
	- solve these subtasks independetly
	- recombne the subtask results into a final result
		-> Merge Sort

Map Reduce is a functional paradigm

	Mappers  - filter and transform data
		-> combiners - perform reducer operations on the mapper node (for optimization..dont worry)
		-> partitioner - perform reducer operations on the mapper node (for optimization..dont worry)
	Reducers - Aggregate Results




Zen of Map Reduce:
	"All Records for a given key are processed by the same reducer task!"
