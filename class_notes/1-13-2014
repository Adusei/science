CONTENT BASED FILTERING

		- Show users things similar to other items theve consumed

		Pandora is Content Based!

		For my project implementation is:
			Calculate Tag Estimates for Users and Tracks (same feature space - columns are tags)
			Predict Rankings by taking dot product

		Example:

		=======

			Features = (burning Man, Deep House, Get Physical, Berlin) - Ranked 1 to 5

			Blondish Live At Burning Man (5, 2, 4, -2) 
			Ben Klock CLR podcast (-3, -1, -5, 5)
			Mandy Presents Get Physical (0, 4, 5, 1)

			Johns Preferences: (4,5,2,4)

			take the dot product!

		=======

COLABORATIVE BASED FILTERING

More Modern

All abotu the ratings matrix

								10k tracks
						------------

						|
1m users		|

						------------


2 Techniques:
		- Item based CF (memory based CF)
			-- > clustering after
		- Model Based Collaborative Filtering
			-- > Dimensionality Reduction (map to the latent features)


Dont you need metadata about users/items to get predicted ratings?
	- No! thats the point :D
