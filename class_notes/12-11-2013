Clustering (unsupervises)

Goal is to extract and enhance natural structure of the data (not to impose structure)


K-Means clustering
	- Greedy learner that partitions a dat set into k clusteres
	- greedy (captures local structure (depends on initial conditions))

Partitions are determined 
	-- > each point is assigned to the cluster wiht the nearest centroid

Partitions are not scale invariant!
	-- > Same data can yeild differnet results depeniding on the scale and units useed
	-- > 

	Basic K means algo
		- choose k initial centroides (k is an input)
		- for each poitn
			- find distance to each centroid
			- assign point to nearest centroid
		- recalculate centroid positions
		- repeat steps 2-3 until stopping chriteria met



		TEXT MINING:
			- Jaccard Coefficient
			- TFIDF
