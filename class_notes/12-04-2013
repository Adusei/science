ENSEMBLE TECHNIQUES - Methods of improving classification accuracy by aggregating preiction over several base classifiers
	- Base classifiers should be low bais and uncoorelated


Decisition Tree is a high variance classifier


Problems in Classification
	- Statistical problem
	- Computational problem
	- represenation problem


	DECISION TREES
			-> a decisioin tree works by forming a rectilinear partition of the featree space
			-> rectilinear -> decision boundries are perpandicular to axis


  BAGGING (bootstrap aggregating)
  Sample With Replacement
  	- pick a card... put it back... probability of you pulling that card is the same as the first time

  BOOSTING
  Boosting is an iterative procedure that adaptively changes the sampling distribution of trainin records at each iteration
  	- start with uniform weights
  	- in next itreatinon adjust weights to ephasize records that were misclassified in previous iterations
  	- final prediction constructed by a weighted vote
  	- Ataboost; gradient boosted machine


  RANDOM FOREST
  	- Ensemble of decision trees where earch base classifier is grown using a random effect

Check out Diettrick Ensemble Paper
	- A few lessons to learn about machine learning
	

With random forest when predicting a record... make 100 preductions (you have 100 trees) then vote! either on average or a weighted average



TODOS 
	- Set up Emacs
	- Set up MySQL
	- ipdb practice
	- how to call help on sklearn models
	- install crab
	- review bais variance
	- where is my rails book?
	- data aa
	- add to nltk code:
			@john you can do it like this:
			cv.fit(test_features)
			scratch that. sorry.
			once you train your model, you can do this:
			clf.score(testfeatures,testlabels)
			clf.predict(test_features) would give you your prediction array
			data/nb_test.csv
