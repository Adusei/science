Goal: Construct a data set that relates Last.fm tags to each other, revealing 
which genres (and other tags) are most associated.  Define score for similarity between tags, output a text file with related tags and their score descending.  In addition, output transitional data sets, specifically relevant tags per artist.

Resources:
	• API details: http://www.last.fm/api/intro
	• Top Artists method: http://www.last.fm/api/show/chart.getTopArtists
	• Top Tags method: http://www.last.fm/api/show/artist.getTopTags
	• Getting Started I used: http://snipplr.com/view/63161/


Use Tag Count Distro as scoring mechanism
Create Score
save a file with artist to tags.. only relevant tags.. use tag_cnt pct
output the related tags to txt
Dont Dupe tags in query

make table objects class variables ( only define them once )






What would this process/schema look like in redis??
