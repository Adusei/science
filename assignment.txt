Applicant Assignment: Data Engineer

The purpose of this assignment is to test your comfort, skill, and creativity with 

the kind of data engineering tasks we regularly perform at Seed.

Goal: Construct a data set that relates Last.fm tags to each other, revealing 

which genres (and other tags) are most associated.

Details: Using the Last.fm API, collect the top tags among a large set of 

popular artists (1000 or more). This data should be structured and stored in 

whatever format you deem most efficient. From this raw data, create a metric 

that compares how strongly associated the tags are to each other. Feel free to 

include any weighting or balancing in your metric, as long as you can explain it.

Resources:

• API details: http://www.last.fm/api/intro

• Top Artists method: http://www.last.fm/api/show/chart.getTopArtists

• Top Tags method: http://www.last.fm/api/show/artist.getTopTags

Deliverables:

• Your clean, commented code — Python or Node.js strongly preferred.

• Your data sets, both intermediate steps and the final output.

• Short explanation of process and outcomes.

Extra credit ideas:

• Use your tags data to compute the similarity between artists.

• Compare your tags data to the “similar tags” data in the API. Highlight 

what is the same and what is different.

• Come up with your own next step about how to make your data set more 

interesting
